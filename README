1.This C program implements two vector addition of N size which can be givenby the user.
2.First do sh make.sh to compile the C files to get an executable file.
3.Then run sh run.sh N_OPS N_ENTRIES to run the program, here N_OPS is No of vector additions that needs to be done on N_ENTRIES (size of each vector).
4.This program uses dynamic memory allocation technique to handle the vectors.
5.There is a Makefile written to compile the C code to give an executable file.
